Once you [installed Chisel](/docs/installation), you can setup a project by running the following command on the command line:

```bash
chisel create
```

Chisel asks you a few questions about your project and allows you to choose the project type. You can set up two different types of project:

- [WordPress Website Setup](/docs/setup/wordpress)
- [Static Website Setup](/docs/setup/static)

Chisel then creates all required files for your project and installs necessary software.
