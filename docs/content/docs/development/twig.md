In WordPress projects, Twig is implemented via [Timber](https://www.upstatement.com/timber/). In front-end projects, Twig is supported via its JavaScript implementation, [Twig.js](https://github.com/twigjs/twig.js).

Twig syntax is very intuitive and flexible. For more details on how to work with it, check out the [documentation](https://twig.symfony.com/doc/2.x/).

When writing Twig templates, follow official [Twig coding standards](https://twig.symfony.com/doc/2.x/coding_standards.html).
