##
At Xfive we love WordPress but we think that WordPress development could be a slightly more pleasant experience. That’s why we are fans of [Timber library](https://upstatement.com/timber/). 

A few years ago we created Chisel, a tool for creating and developing WordPress themes based on Timber.

The latest version of Chisel was completely rewritten to Webpack and adds a bunch of new [features](https://rewrite-with-webpack-docs-redesign--getchisel.netlify.app/docs/features), including support for static websites.

If you are looking for documentation of the previous, Gulp based, version, it’s [here](https://old.getchisel.co/).
